This repository demonstrates how to use [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) to build a hierarchical agent system that searches for Twitter accounts related to a topic. The `twitter_account_searcher.ipynb` notebook shows the full workflow.

Before running the notebook, set the following environment variables with your API credentials:

- `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`
- `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SERPER_API_KEY`

Then open the notebook and follow the steps to collect 1000 unique Twitter accounts.
